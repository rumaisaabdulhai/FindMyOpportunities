## Executive Summary

Many high schools look for service hours as a requirement for graduation. With this, many students have a hard time finding a suitable place to volunteer that matches their passions and interests. While over 90% of Americans want to volunteer, only 1 in 4 actually does (Youtopoulus). Moreover, the second most common reason why people don’t volunteer is because of a lack of interest and inflexible schedules with volunteer organizations (Youtopolous). 16% of interested volunteers don’t volunteer because of a lack of local opportunities (Kotecha). Thus, to increase volunteer interest and retention rates, it becomes imperative to increase awareness currently existing community service opportunities that potential volunteers would be interested in. This application targets young adults in school to motivate them to participate in community service while providing students opportunities to give back to their community based on their needs and time constraints. It also helps organizations, in need of people, who are looking to market volunteer opportunities.

## Introduction

### Problem
Many students with mandatory community service requirements or students just looking to give back to the community struggle to find volunteer opportunities they find attuned to their interests. 16% of potential volunteers don’t volunteer due to a lack of nearby volunteer opportunities (Kotecha). Moreover, the second most common reason people don’t volunteer is due to a lack of interesting volunteer opportunities (Youtopoulus). This creates a need to provide a platform where potential volunteers can be fully aware of interesting volunteer opportunities nearby. Moreover, many nonprofits and other organizations often struggle to pick up interested volunteers. We believe that this arises due to the lack of a common platform between volunteers and organizations that need them. Indeed, the problem is the accessibility of community service opportunities to both people looking to volunteer and organizations that could use potential volunteers.

### Audience
The audience is anyone that is looking to volunteer, but more specifically students that might wish to volunteer, but cannot find the right fit for them. A lot of high schools, especially, require a certain amount of service hours, and for students, if they are not spending the hours doing something they enjoy, it would be more or less a waste of time. Moreover, this app is also aimed at organizations looking for volunteers for events, fundraisers, and as long-term helpers. Therefore, this app would allow not only for students to find a place to enjoy volunteering, but organizations to gain volunteers that are eager to work in a certain field.

### Competition
Naviance, a college preparation website used by many schools in the nation, has a community service search tab for finding opportunities for students to help other organizations. However, not all organizations may be listed on the database, and so our goal is to find as many organizations that really require the help of students so that they can benefit. We will also categorize the different types of community service by convenience and location for example so students do not have to travel far to make an impact in their communities. Moreover, the app Treedom has a similar goal-- it provides potential volunteers with opportunities of nearby nonprofits, helps them log and track their hours, as well as setting goals for future community service. The app has a friendly interface and is “very helpful”. However, the app does not have many downloads and does not aid volunteers in selecting opportunities based on their interests.

## Specifications

### Features
The main goal of this app is to provide a platform for volunteers and organizations to market and find community service opportunities. Features that this app will support is an easy search interface for volunteering opportunities in the vicinity of the client, and an interface for organizations to market their volunteering opportunities. Therefore, the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for this application would be an interface for finding volunteering opportunities for students who want to volunteer but have time constraints and other limitations.

### Feedback
We can get feedback on the app based on app ratings on the Android/IOS app store, as well as personal feedback from organizations and potential clients that we reach out to. We will adapt the code/functionality of our app to tier to general trends we notice in the reviews.

### Future addition
A potential addition would be having a feature that can track the number of hours that a person spends with a particular organization. Another addition would be having the user create an account to save the organizations they have worked for and leave reviews or ratings on the particular organization. Also, the user could be able to fill the forms for the particular community service and have it signed by the organization through the app. We are planning to draw inspiration from Reflectly, a self-care app for a friendly user-interface.

## Platform
This project will require a mobile application for a smartphone or tablet device. The application may be developed on an IOS Platform as we believe it will reach more people and we will be able to easily test it as we and our peers use more IOS devices. However, we are also seriously considering developing the application on an Android Platform, and if we go with this option we would be using Android Studio which uses Java and Android API.
